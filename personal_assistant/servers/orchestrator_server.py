- For expense operations: Contact the Expense Tracker directly  
- For complex queries: Continue using this orchestrator for coordinated responses

**Available Services:**
I coordinate between two specialized agents to help you:

**Meeting Management:**
- Schedule and manage meetings
- Check for conflicts  
- Update meeting details
- Search meetings by various criteria

**Expense Tracking:**
- Record and categorize expenses
- Generate spending summaries
- Analyze budgets and spending patterns

- Combine meeting and expense information
- Provide comprehensive personal assistance
- Coordinate complex multi-domain queries

**How to Use:**
- Ask meeting questions like: "Schedule a team standup tomorrow at 9 AM"
- Ask expense questions like: "How much did I spend on food this month?"
- Ask combined questions like: "What meetings do I have and what's my spending this week?"
