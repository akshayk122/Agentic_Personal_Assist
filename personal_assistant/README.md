# Personal Assistant System

A multi-agent personal assistant system using Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) servers that manages meetings and expenses through specialized agents and a central orchestrator.

## 🚀 Quick Start with UV

```bash
# 1. Install uv (modern Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2. Clone and setup the project
cd personal_assistant
uv sync

# 3. Configure environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY

# 4. Start servers (3 separate terminals)
make meeting      # Terminal 1: Meeting Manager (port 8100)
make expense      # Terminal 2: Expense Tracker (port 8200) 
make orchestrator # Terminal 3: Orchestrator (port 8300)

# 5. Launch Streamlit UI (4th terminal - optional)
make streamlit    # Terminal 4: Web UI (port 8501)

# 6. Test the system
uv run python -c "
import asyncio
from acp_sdk.client import Client

async def test():
    async with Client(base_url='http://localhost:8300') as client:
        response = await client.run_sync(
            agent='personal_assistant',
            input='What can you help me with?'
        )
        print(response.output[0].parts[0].content)

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone or create the project directory
cd personal_assistant

# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies using uv
uv sync

# Set up environment variables
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

**Alternative installation methods:**
```bash
# Using pip to install uv
pip install uv

# Then sync dependencies
uv sync

# Or install specific dependency groups
uv sync --extra dev    # Install with development dependencies
uv sync --extra test   # Install with testing dependencies
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Edit your `.env` file:

```env
# Google AI API Key (Required)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Server Configuration (Default values)
MEETING_SERVER_PORT=8100
EXPENSE_SERVER_PORT=8200
ORCHESTRATOR_SERVER_PORT=8300

# AI Model Configuration
MODEL_NAME=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
MAX_TOKENS=1024
```

### 3. Start the Servers

You need to run each server in a separate terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Meeting Manager
cd personal_assistant
uv run python servers/meeting_server.py

# Terminal 2: Expense Tracker  
cd personal_assistant
uv run python servers/expense_server.py

# Terminal 3: Orchestrator
cd personal_assistant
uv run python servers/orchestrator_server.py
```

**Alternative using project scripts:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Meeting Manager
uv run meeting-server

# Terminal 2: Expense Tracker
uv run expense-server

# Terminal 3: Orchestrator
uv run orchestrator-server
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Using Streamlit Web UI (Recommended)

1. **Start all servers** (in separate terminals):
   ```bash
   make meeting      # Terminal 1
   make expense      # Terminal 2  
   make orchestrator # Terminal 3
   ```

2. **Launch the web interface**:
   ```bash
   make streamlit    # Terminal 4
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

4. **Start chatting!** Try these example queries:
   - "Schedule a team standup tomorrow at 9 AM"
   - "I spent $25 on lunch at Subway today"
   - "What meetings do I have this week and how much did I spend on food?"

The web UI provides:
- 💬 **Interactive chat interface** with your personal assistant
- 📊 **Real-time server status** monitoring
- 💡 **Example queries** for quick actions  
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** responsive design

### Using ACP SDK Client (Programmatic)

```python
import asyncio
from acp_sdk.client import Client

async def example_usage():
    # Query the orchestrator for complex requests
    async with Client(base_url="http://localhost:8300") as client:
        # Combined query
        response = await client.run_sync(
            agent="personal_assistant",
            input="What meetings do I have this week and how much did I spend on food?"
        )
        print(response.output[0].parts[0].content)
    
    # Query meeting manager directly
    async with Client(base_url="http://localhost:8100") as client:
        response = await client.run_sync(
            agent="meeting_manager",
            input="Schedule a team standup tomorrow at 9 AM"
        )
        print(response.output[0].parts[0].content)
    
    # Query expense tracker directly
    async with Client(base_url="http://localhost:8200") as client:
        response = await client.run_sync(
            agent="expense_tracker",
            input="I spent $25 on dinner at Italian restaurant"
        )
        print(response.output[0].parts[0].content)

# Run the example
asyncio.run(example_usage())

# Save as example.py and run with:
# uv run python example.py
```

### Example Queries

#### Meeting Management
- "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM for project review"
- "Show me all meetings this week"
- "Find meetings with Sarah in the attendees"
- "Cancel the meeting with ID m001"
- "Check for conflicts on Friday at 3 PM"

#### Expense Tracking
- "I spent $12.50 on lunch at Subway today"
- "Show me all food expenses this month"
- "How much did I spend on transportation this quarter?"
- "Give me a budget analysis for entertainment"
- "What's my total spending this week?"

#### Combined Queries (via Orchestrator)
- "What meetings do I have today and what did I spend yesterday?"
- "Show my schedule for next week and my food budget status"
- "Do I have any lunch meetings this week and what's my restaurant spending?"

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Meeting Manager (Port 8100)
- **POST** `/runs` - Agent: `meeting_manager`

### Expense Tracker (Port 8200)
- **POST** `/runs` - Agent: `expense_tracker`

### Orchestrator (Port 8300)
- **POST** `/runs` - Agent: `personal_assistant`

## 📊 Data Storage

The system uses JSON files for data persistence:

### meetings.json
```json
{
  "meeting_id": "uuid",
  "title": "Meeting Title",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "time": "HH:MM",
  "duration_minutes": 60,
  "attendees": ["email1@domain.com"],
  "location": "Conference Room A",
  "description": "Meeting description",
  "status": "scheduled|completed|cancelled"
}
```

### expenses.json
```json
{
  "expense_id": "uuid", 
  "amount": 25.50,
  "currency": "USD",
  "category": "food",
  "subcategory": "lunch",
  "description": "Restaurant meal",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "payment_method": "credit",
  "tags": ["business", "client"]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using the port
   lsof -i :8100
   
   # Kill the process or use different ports in .env
   ```

2. **Google API Key Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify your API key is set
   echo $GOOGLE_API_KEY
   
   # Ensure it has Gemini API access enabled
   ```

3. **Module Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're in the right directory
   cd personal_assistant
   
   # Check Python path with uv
   uv run python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
   
   # Verify uv environment
   uv run python -c "import personal_assistant; print('Success!')"
   ```

4. **Data File Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Ensure data directory is writable
   chmod 755 data/
   ```

### Performance Tips

- Use the orchestrator for complex queries spanning multiple domains
- Query specialized agents directly for single-domain operations
- Monitor server logs for performance bottlenecks
- Consider increasing `max_tokens` for complex responses
